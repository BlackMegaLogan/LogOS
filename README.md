# LogOS

**LogOS** is a work-in-progress OS framework written in Go. It aims to create a
simplistic computing experience both with its internal workings and usability.

**LogOS** is built upon the Triple L Framework, including:

- **Lush** – The command-line interface
- **Long** – The planned backend language (coming soon)
- **Light** – GUI and graphical shell (coming soon)


## Getting Started
```bash
git clone https://github.com/BlackMegaLogan/LogOS
cd LogOS
# Build LITTLE, the minimal CLI interpreter
