# LogOS

LogOS is an experimental operating system framework written in Go. The project aims to deliver a minimalist computing experience with an emphasis on simplicity and ease of use.

## Triple L Framework

LogOS is built around three planned components:

- **Lush** – Command-line interface
- **Long** – Backend language (coming soon)
- **Light** – GUI and graphical shell (coming soon)

## Getting Started

The project is still in its very early stages. Once source code becomes available you will be able to clone the repository and run the main program with Go:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/BlackMegaLogan/LogOS
cd LogOS
go run cmd/logos/main.go
```

As development progresses, additional setup steps and documentation will be provided.
