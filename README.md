# LogOS

**LogOS** is a experimental OS framework forked from. Barrelfish. It aims to create a
simplistic computing experience from its multikernel model.

(It's likely that there will be multiple LogOS versions in the future, LogOS won't only be based on Barrelfish.)

**LogOS** is built upon the Triple L Framework, including:

- **LUSH/LITTLE** – The two separate shells to ensure your computing experience is interchangeable.
- **Long** – The planned backend language (coming soon)
- **Light** – GUI and graphical shell (coming soon)
